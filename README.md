# Proposal
Because of extremely limited knowledge about reactive programming, I am yet to figure out exactly what I propose.
Instead, I am trying to some POC (proof of concept) of what reactive programming has to offer.

Based on my learnings, I'll prepare a benchmarking test suite, which will evaluate in what condition it makes sense to use
reactive paradigm. 
Moreover, how is debugging done effectively can be added to scope.
